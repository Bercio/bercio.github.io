I have started this blog with the intention of writing about interesting things
I'm learning about, mainly math, physics and programming. I want to do this in
order to practice my writing and especially to help myself learn better.

I believe trying to explain something really shows weather you
truly understand it or not. Formulating something clearly enough that others,
:even if inexperienced on the subject, understand it pushes you to get at the
core of the matter.

During the process of writing something in a clear, readable manner,
your understanding too, often, gets clearer. It's much easier to have a confused
understanding and deceive yourself that it is, instead, clear, than to write

something confuse and approximate and deceive yourself, even despite the opinion
of the occasional and often unforgiving comments[^1], that it is clear and precise.

I also think that blogs are a great way of improving your writing thanks to the
feedback you receive through comments and the pressure on writing
clearly, concisely and carefully that publishing something puts on you.

[^1]: I won't put comments on this blog. Instead, I will share posts I think
are worthy of comments on reddit (readers are of course encouraged to do the
same) and put a link to the reddit comments in the post.
